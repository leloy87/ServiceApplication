Service Application Read Me
This application is designed for users to report issues, attach files (such as images or documents), and submit them for review. Users can provide a location, category, and description of the issue, and optionally attach files for better clarification. The application validates user input and stores submitted issues in memory for future retrieval.
1.	Main Menu
Upon starting the application, you will be presented with the Main Menu with four options:
•	Report Issues (currently implemented): Clicking this button takes the user to the Report Issues form.
•	Local Events and Announcements (not implemented)
•	Service Request Status: (not implemented)
•	Exit: (currently implemented): I have implemented an exit confirmation dialog to prevent users from accidentally closing the application, when the Exit button is clicked.
